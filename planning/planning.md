- Express/Node  | Backend
- FramerMotion  | Page transitions
- Currents API

I was thinking if I finished MVP fast enough I would like to add Playwright or Jest or I think was it Cypress?
Some testing framework because none of my portfolio projects demonstrate that I can write unit or end-to-end tests




MVP Features:
> Currents API will provide articles across categories
> 
> Users can see a title, image, and description for each article
> 
> Each article will have a link to the actual article on its original site
> 
>Authentication(I'm thinking Google 0Auth for this one)
>
>Users can add articles to their own list
>
>Animated carousel for viewing articles
>
>2 Models, User and Articles. Users will have a list field that is an array of articles
>
>Mobile responsive
>
>Page transitions


These two features I'm not sure if they should be MVP or not
>Delete articles from user's list
>
>Article filtering via category(category is provided by the API)
>



My overall goals with this project are: 
1. Use Nextjs to serverside fetch all of the articles and then client side render only the necessary components so Users will have no loading times and a completely seamless article scroller
2. Keep the backend as simple as possible so that I can
3. Focus the majority of my energy on the Frontend and UX. This is the area that I am most lacking and I want to dedicate this last project to becoming a well rounded developer

I'm hoping to get the Auth, MEN backend, and the API under wraps by the end of day 2 so I can spend the rest of the time on styling, page transitions, and most importantly, mobile responsiveness. I have yet to build a single mobile responsive app.
