News Match is a mobile responsive full-stack web application that allows users to sift through news articles with the user experience of swiping through a dating app like Tinder. It takes full advantage of Nextjs's ability to pre-fetch and cache data before the user comes to the site to create an article-scrolling experience that has 0 loading screens.
